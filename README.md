## Local Development

### Requirements

#### Node.js

Please install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) `>= v22` and [npm](https://nodejs.org/) `>= v10`. You will find it
easier to use the Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To use the correct version of Node.js for this application, via nvm:

```bash
nvm use
```

### Setup

Install application dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running local tests

Start application you are testing on the url specified in `baseUrl` [playwright.local.config.js](playwright.local.config.js)

```bash
npm run test:local
```

### Debugging local tests

```bash
npm run test:local:debug
```

### Reporting

This test suite uses **Allure** for generating test reports that are compatible with the CDP Portal infrastructure. Allure provides:

- CDP Portal integration
- Historical test trends  
- S3 publishing pipeline
- Enterprise reporting standards

The test configuration generates Allure reports in `allure-results/` (raw data) and `allure-report/` (HTML report).

## Production

### Running the tests

Tests are run from the CDP-Portal under the Test Suites section. Before any changes can be run, a new docker image must be built, this will happen automatically when a pull request is merged into the `main` branch.
You can check the progress of the build under the actions section of this repository. Builds typically take around 1-2 minutes.

The results of the test run are made available in the portal.

## Requirements of CDP Environment Tests

1. Your service builds as a docker container using the `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
   The workflow tags the docker images allowing the CDP Portal to identify how the container should be run on the platform.
   It also ensures its published to the correct docker repository.

2. The Dockerfile's entrypoint script should return exit code of 0 if the test suite passes or 1/>0 if it fails

3. Test reports should be published to S3 using the script in `./bin/publish-tests.sh` in Allure format

## BrowserStack

Two Playwright configuration files are provided to help run the tests using BrowserStack in both a GitHub workflow (`playwright.github.browserstack.config.js`) and from the CDP Portal (`playwright.browserstack.config.js`).
They can be run from npm using the `npm run test:browserstack` (for running via portal) and `npm run test:github:browserstack` (from GitHub runner).
See the CDP Documentation for more details.

### Environment Variables

Before running BrowserStack tests, you need to set up the following environment variables:

```bash
export BROWSERSTACK_USER=<your_browserstack_username>
export BROWSERSTACK_KEY=<your_browserstack_access_key>
```

### GOV.UK Browser Requirements Coverage

For the complete list of browsers that GOV.UK services should support, see: [GOV.UK Service Manual - Designing for different browsers and devices](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/designing-for-different-browsers-and-devices)

The table below shows which required browsers are tested by our BrowserStack configuration:

| Platform | Browser | BrowserStack Test | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------------------|-------|
| **Windows** | Chrome | ‚úÖ |  |
| **Windows** | Edge | ‚úÖ |  |
| **Windows** | Firefox | ‚úÖ |  |
| **macOS** | Safari | ‚úÖ |  |
| **macOS** | Chrome | ‚úÖ |  |
| **macOS** | Firefox | ‚úÖ |  |
| **iOS** | Safari | ‚ö†Ô∏è | In Beta |
| **iOS** | Chrome | ‚ùå | Not supported |
| **Android** | Chrome | ‚ùå | Not supported |
| **Android** | Samsung Internet | ‚ùå | Not supported |

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Test all working browsers against localhost
npm run test:local:browserstack

# Test all working browsers against deployed service
npm run test:browserstack
```
